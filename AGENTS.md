# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
`cubrid-client` is a TypeScript-first client library for CUBRID.

## Read First
- `README.md`
- `PRD.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/agent-playbook.md`

## Working Rules
- Keep public TypeScript API, examples, and docs aligned.
- Preserve typed query ergonomics and transaction behavior unless intentionally redesigning the contract.
- Prefer compatibility-safe changes because this repo is library code.
- Add or update tests for any protocol or public client behavior change.

## Development Workflow (cubrid-lab org standard)

Apply **identical PR review and merge criteria** regardless of whether
code was written by a person, OpenCode, Codex, Claude Code, ChatGPT,
Copilot or any other agent. No specific AI review is a prerequisite.

1. Implement a focused change with tests and affected documentation.
2. Required GitHub Actions CI checks, appropriate to this repository,
   are the authoritative verification at the final head. Local testing
   is recommended but not an additional required gate.
3. Review correctness, tests, security, API compatibility, maintainability,
   and scope. Oracle, Copilot and `agent-review` findings are optional,
   **advisory**, and never automatic approval or rejection.
4. Disposition outstanding findings and let the responsible maintainer
   decide on merge after checking required CI. Security, CI permissions,
   release and publication changes need explicit independent review.

Preserve existing branch protection, integration tests, compatibility and
release safeguards. Do not create tool-dependent Oracle/Copilot routes.

## Validation
- `npm run typecheck`
- `npm test`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run check`

## Project Context — Performance Loop System

> This repo is a **supporting track** (nice-to-have) for the Performance Loop.

### Role

cubrid-client already benchmarks **faster than MySQL** in TypeScript.
The narrative is "already fast, now production-ready" — resilience, not speed.
